An Alexa Skill to interact with the Metro Transit NexTrip API


This skill only looks up the departure times for the Metro Transit Green Line. The user needs to inform alexa of the station that they want to get the times for.
The skill then returns the next two trains in each direction for the station in question.

This Skill is using the NexTrip API for Metro Transit: http://svc.metrotransit.org
